# PICO-8 Games

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. 
It feels like a regular console, but runs on Windows / Mac / Linux. 
When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a commandline, 
a suite of cartridge creation tools, and an online cartridge browser called SPLORE.
